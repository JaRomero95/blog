They say there is no need to create a new method if it is made up of a single line of code, that leaving the code in a higher-order place is enough because it is easy to understand. But I can’t agree with that. A good enough code Let’s see an example. Imagine that we are creating a service to export a file wit... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Avoid Vue.set - Reactivity and immutability</title><link href="https://www.jaromero.es/posts/avoid-vue-set/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Avoid Vue.set - Reactivity and immutability" /><published>2020-01-16T18:00:00+01:00</published> <updated>2021-11-06T16:27:20+01:00</updated> <id>https://www.jaromero.es/posts/avoid-vue-set/</id> <content src="https://www.jaromero.es/posts/avoid-vue-set/" /> <author> <name>Juan Antonio Romero Molero</name> </author> <category term="Frontend" /> <summary> Introduction Vue uses reactivity to listen for changes in component data and update the view if necessary after a change. To achieve this, Vue adds getters and setters that wrap each property that we define. When we modify a value, we are calling the setter method that was created earlier.
